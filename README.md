The C file ( [set_wm_class.c](https://gist.github.com/tgr/eae411cefde08cbed5c59d4f51ddb062) ) for changing the WM_CLASS comes from [Tisza Gerg≈ë](https://github.com/tgr). The creator is not involved in this project.

## Installation

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/robertomorrison0/tlauncher-arch.git tlauncher
$ cd tlauncher
$ makepkg -si
```

## Updating

To update TLauncher repeat the install process as it will download the latest version automatically.
The Launcher itself does not have sufficiant perissions to update.

## Problems

The script for setting the icons is not exiting on application close.
It can be 'fixed' by running `killall tlauncher` in the terminal, after closing the application.
